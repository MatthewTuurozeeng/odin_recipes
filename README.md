# odin_recipes

This is a beginner-level web development project built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It showcases basic webpage structure, linking, and the use of images and lists.

The project features a simple website that contains popular Ghanaian recipes: **Jollof Rice**, **Waakye**, and **Fufu**. The goal of the project was to practice basic HTML structure, linking between pages, displaying images, and organizing content clearly.
